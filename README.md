This is supposed to be a side hobby of mine to work on, initially the idea came from the time I made myself a UX animation mockup of some retro games.

I am fairly satisfied with it, but I have a longing urge to somehow make it interactive.

This is my attempt to make that a reality, I'll be trying to replicate all of it in pure html elements instead of `<canvas>`.

#### TODOS
- main menus settings
- volume bars on audio
- saveslot and sys prompt
